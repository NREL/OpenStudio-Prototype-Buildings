! -----------------------------------------------------------------------
! The 90.1 Prototype Building Models were developed by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), 
! under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).  These building models were originally derived from 
! DOE’s Commercial Reference Building Models with modifications from ASHRAE 90.1 committee, 
! Advanced Energy Design Guide series, and other building industry expert input.  
! The original purpose of developing these prototype building models was to measure energy saving impacts from 
! newly published editions of ASHRAE Standard 90.1.  The basic building descriptions can be found in the Scorecards 
! posted at this website.  The detailed descriptions of the prototype model development and addenda modeling 
! strategies can be found in PNNL’s reports, entitled "Achieving 30% Goal: Energy and Cost Saving Analysis 
! of ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1-2010" and "Enhancements to ASHRAE Standard 90.1 Prototype Building Models", 
! both posted at this website.

! reset R value of semi-heated Roof to 0.001 if the R values goes below 0.001.  V4.0 has a 0.001 threshold with it.
!
! Revision 1.1  2010/01/20 21:49:30  d3l143
! Initial revision
!
! Note: 
! January 20, 2010: We experienced a problem in upgrading Warehouse from V3.0 to V4.0. 
!                   The R value of the semiheated roof goes to around 0.0002 for Miami and Ryihad which V4.0 compliants that it is below 0.001.
!                   This was not a problem for V3.0.  Here we implemented a temporal solution to re-set the r value to 0.001 when it is below it.
